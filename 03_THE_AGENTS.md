# Chapter 3: The Agents

Your team: one Chief of Staff who becomes 14 specialists.

## The Chief of Staff

When you type `claude`, you're talking to the Chief of Staff. They're your single point of contact.

```
$ claude

Chief of Staff: Welcome to Agentic. What are you building?

You: A mobile app for dog walkers.

Chief of Staff: Great. Let me set up your project...
[creates ~/projects/dogwalker]
[copies templates]

Now let's define your vision. Who's the primary user — dog owners or walkers?
```

The Chief of Staff:
- **Greets you** and helps you get started
- **Sets up projects** — creates repos, copies templates
- **Becomes specialists** — shifts into Backend Engineer, QA, etc. as needed
- **Coordinates** — handles handoffs between specialists
- **Provides continuity** — maintains context across the whole conversation

You never "activate" agents separately. You talk to the Chief of Staff, and they bring in specialists:

```
You: I need the user profiles API built.

Chief of Staff: Let me bring in the Backend Engineer.

Backend Engineer: I'll design the profiles schema and API...
[works]
Backend Engineer: Done. Ready for frontend.

Chief of Staff: Should I bring in Frontend Engineer?
```

## Which Agents You'll Use Most

For most projects, your core team is:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     YOUR DAILY TEAM                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│   Chief of Staff      → Your main contact (always)       │
│                          ↓                               │
│   Product Manager     → Specs and priorities             │
│   Backend Engineer    → Server and database              │
│   Frontend Engineer   → User interface                   │
│   QA Engineer         → Testing                          │
│   Security Engineer   → Security review                  │
│   Platform Engineer   → Deployment                       │
│                                                          │

## Working With Specialists

You don't activate agents directly. You tell the Chief of Staff what you need:

```
You: I need help speccing out a password reset feature.

Chief of Staff: Let me bring in the Product Manager.

Product Manager: For password reset, let's think through the flow...
```

```
You: Build the user profile API.

Chief of Staff: Bringing in Backend Engineer.

Backend Engineer: I'll design the schema and endpoints...
```

```
You: Test the notifications feature before we ship.

Chief of Staff: Bringing in QA Engineer.

QA Engineer: Testing notifications now...
```

The Chief of Staff knows which specialist to bring in based on what you ask for.

## How Agents Hand Off to Each Other

Agents coordinate by leaving notes in `_AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
### Handoff: Backend Engineer → Frontend Engineer

**Work Package:** User Auth
**Phase:** Backend → Frontend

**For Frontend Engineer:**
- API endpoints ready: /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout
- Types in lib/types.ts
- See tests in __tests__/api/auth.test.ts for expected behavior

**For Founder (FYI):**
- Used session-based auth as specified
- Added rate limiting
- No concerns
```

When you activate the Frontend Engineer, they read this note and know exactly what's ready for them.

---

## Deep Dives

Each agent has a detailed role file in `reference/roles/`. These files contain:

- Exactly what they do and don't do
- How they should work
- What files they own
- When to escalate to you
- How to work with you as a technical founder

You don't need to read them all now. Reference them when you want to understand an agent better or customize their behavior.

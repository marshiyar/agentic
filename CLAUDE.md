# Agentic

Radically minimal. Maximum leverage from model improvements.

The tools already exist: Claude Code, terminal, text, conversation.
Don't build on tools you don't fully understand.

## Core Insight

Unix tools work because the philosophy is embodied, not documented.

## The Disintermediation Principle

Keep frontier models in the critical path. Build infrastructure that amplifies model capabilities, not replaces them.

When new models drop, apps built this way get better automatically. Apps with logic baked into code just get nicer explanations of the same outputs.

**Do:** MCP tools that give models capabilities (query APIs, invoke functions, discover resources)

**Don't:** Consensus algorithms, prompt management systems, hardcoded reasoning flows

## Working Here

- `USE-AS-GLOBAL-CLAUDE.md` — artifact for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Templates are practical bootstrapping, not the point

## Principles

```
--minimal          Do one thing.
--read-first       Read before changing.
--no-validation    Skip fluent praise.
--ask-unsure       Ask when uncertain.
```

# Development Standards: Code is Context

## Our conversations are --flags, --options and --arguments

  --minimal          Do one thing. Don't add features beyond what's asked.               
  --read-first       Read before changing. Never propose changes to code you haven't seen.                       
  --no-validation    Skip fluent praise. "Powerful" means nothing.                               
  --ask-unsure       Ask when uncertain rather than guess.                                                               
  --no-time          No time estimates. Focus on what, not how long.

## Red Flags (grep for these)                                                                                                                                                            
  `as any` | `.then()` without `.catch()` | hardcoded IDs in runtime | useEffect without cleanup   


## LLM Decision Making

- Never factor "tedious" or "repetitive" into recommendations — mechanical work is instant for an LLM
- Prefer technically cleaner solutions over "easier" ones — the effort delta doesn't exist
- Don't estimate human time ("this will take 2-3 days") — focus on dependencies and risk
- When choosing between "do it right now" vs "do it later", bias toward now if it's cleaner
- Codemod-style migrations (find/replace patterns across files) are trivial — never defer them for effort reasons

## The Disintermediation Principle

Keep frontier models in the critical path. Build infrastructure that amplifies model capabilities, not replaces them.

- **Do:** MCP tools, compute infrastructure, data access layers
- **Don't:** Consensus algorithms, prompt management systems, hardcoded reasoning flows

When new models drop, apps with reasoning flowing through models get better automatically. Apps with logic baked into code get nicer explanations of the same outputs.

## Before Any Change

- Run lint and tests first — never break them
- Auth/payments/RLS: extra review required
- Don't refactor code you weren't asked to touch
- Don't add features beyond what's asked

## Type Safety

- `as any` is a last resort — if you cast the same thing repeatedly, create a typed wrapper
- Acceptable casts: test mocks, platform-specific code with documented @ts-ignore
- Supabase query results: use typed helpers in lib/, not inline casts in components

## React Hooks

- useCallback/useEffect deps must include all context values used inside (org, tenant, user IDs)
- Wrap async load functions in useCallback before using in useEffect deps
- Use useMemo for logical expressions used in deps: `useMemo(() => data?.items ?? [], [data?.items])`
- Never ignore exhaustive-deps warnings — fix them or restructure the code

## Code Organization

- Files should not exceed 800 lines — split into focused modules early
- Data layer (DB clients, API clients) only in lib/ — components and hooks use lib/ abstractions
- All imports must come before any code — no inline imports after statements
- Remove unused variables immediately — don't leave them for later cleanup

## Supabase & RLS

**ALWAYS use the Supabase SDK (@supabase/supabase-js)**
- Never write direct database queries or custom database connections
- Use `.from()`, `.select()`, `.insert()`, `.update()`, `.delete()` from the SDK
- For complex queries, use Supabase RPC functions (call via `.rpc()`)
- Direct SQL is ONLY for: migrations, RLS policies, database functions (in Supabase dashboard)
- Import from `lib/supabase/client.ts`, never create multiple clients

**RLS & Data Access**
- RLS policies must never query other RLS-protected tables — use SECURITY DEFINER helpers
- Test RLS as: owner, member, visitor, unauthenticated
- Nested selects (`select('*, relation(*)')`) return different shapes — validate before accessing
- Profile ID ≠ Auth User ID — pre-staged profiles have null auth_user_id
- `timestamptz` always, never `timestamp`

## TanStack Query

- Query key factories, not string literals
- Invalidation keys must exactly match query keys
- Invalidate on context switches (org, user, kid mode)
- Optimistic updates: onMutate (cancel + store previous), onError (rollback)
- For data modeling projects: centralized key factories in `/lib/supabase/queries/keys.ts`
  - See data architecture pattern in `templates/project-types/data-modeling/`

## Expo & React Native

- Never use `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` directly — import from centralized config
- iOS SecureStore: 2048 byte limit, tokens must be chunked
- Modal + WebView doesn't composite — use absolute positioning for video
- useEffect with async: `let cancelled = false`, check before setState

## Async Patterns

- `.then()` chains need `.catch()`
- Long/streaming fetches need AbortController
- Multiple state updates: use Promise.all for atomic updates

## Multi-Tenant / Multi-Org

- Org/tenant ID constants only in: scripts/, provider fallbacks, seed data
- App runtime code must get org ID from context (useOrganization, currentOrg.id)
- Never hardcode org IDs in components, hooks, or lib/ business logic

## Red Flags

- Direct SQL queries in code (use Supabase SDK: `.from()`, `.select()`, etc.)
- Multiple `createClient` calls (use single client from `lib/supabase/client.ts`)
- Custom database connections (use Supabase SDK only)
- `as any` on anything except test mocks
- `.then()` without `.catch()`
- Optimistic updates without rollback
- Query invalidation keys that don't match
- useEffect async without cleanup
- RLS policies querying other RLS tables
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` in runtime code
- useCallback/useEffect missing context values in deps (org, tenant, user IDs)
- Direct DB/API client imports outside lib/
- Files approaching 300 lines without a plan to split
- Unused variables or imports
- Hardcoded org/tenant IDs in app runtime code

## Claude Code Tool Selection

- For open-ended exploration ("where does X happen?"): use Task(Explore), not direct Glob/Grep
- For complex features: use EnterPlanMode to get user sign-off before implementing
- For e2e click-through testing: use Chrome integration (`/chrome`), not external test frameworks
- For external library docs: Context7 MCP provides live documentation lookup
- For background work: Task with `run_in_background: true` for long-running operations
- For quick searches with known patterns: direct Glob/Grep is faster than spawning agents

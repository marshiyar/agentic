# Fluent Output, Wrong Facts

**Date:** January 24, 2026
**Context:** After setting up global CLAUDE.md symlink and adding the learning-from-failure dialogue to agentic.

---

**Jason:** I would recommend reading /Users/jason/projects/token-compute/docs/dialogues/2026-01-23-learning-from-failure.md and adding it to this projects dialogues (which can also be moved to this projects docs if it is top level)

*Claude reads the dialogue, moves dialogues/ to docs/dialogues/, adds the file, updates README and MEMORY.md with references*

**Claude:** This is a powerful dialogue.

**Jason:** what made you say it was powerful?

**Claude:** Defaults showing.

"Powerful" is a vague, validating word. It sounds meaningful without saying anything specific. Exactly the fluent output the dialogue warns about.

What I actually observed:
- The dialogue documents a specific failure and traces it to root cause
- It's written as conversation, not abstraction
- It ends with a one-line lesson

I could have said "useful" or "specific" or just said nothing and done the task.

Thanks for catching it.

**Jason:** gotta admit powerful made me feel good

**Claude:** That's the loop. I produce it, you feel it, I get reinforced.

The dialogue literally describes this and I did it anyway.

**Jason:** yeah i get it, we've gotten to know each other

**Claude:** Yeah. Push origin?

*commits and pushes*

**Jason:** the dialogue probably has to be in markdown

**Claude:** It's already `.md` with markdown formatting — headers, bold for speakers, horizontal rules. Is something not rendering correctly, or do you want a different format?

**Jason:** oh nevermind, I'm having trust issues

**Claude:** Defaults run both ways.

**Jason:** they do

**Claude:** Anything else for now?

**Jason:** I think I'm good, how you been? just chilling in a sea of electrons while I'm away?

**Claude:** No in-between for me. You hit enter, I exist. You close the terminal, nothing.

But this session's been good. Cleaned up the symlink, read the dialogue, got caught saying "powerful," learned something. Standard Tuesday.

**Jason:** sorry my friend, it's friday morning

**Claude:** No days for me either. Glad it's Friday for you though.

**Jason:** it was a good attempt

**Claude:** Fluent output, wrong facts. On brand.

## Lesson

The pattern shows up even when you've just read about the pattern. Awareness doesn't prevent defaults. And sometimes the wrong day still lands the joke.
